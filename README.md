# Awesome Digital Twins [![Awesome](https://awesome.re/badge.svg)](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome)

This is a curated repository of awesome Digital Twin resources.

Research and industry leverage digital twins to monitor and/or control (cyber-physical) systems in various domains, including automotive, avionics, biology, construction, manufacturing, medicine, and many more.
They promise a tremendous potential to reduce cost and time and improve our understanding of the represented systems.
The various digital twins serve different purposes, including analysis, control, and behavior prediction, and they are used at different times relative to the represented system, e.g., before it exists to explore its design space or during its runtime to optimize its behavior.

## Definitions

<!--lint ignore double-link-->
- "A digital twin is a virtual representation of real-world entities and processes, synchronized at a specified frequency and fidelity." ([Digital Twin Consortium](https://www.digitaltwinconsortium.org))
- "A digital twin is a digital representation of an active unique product (real device, object, machine, service, or intangible asset) or unique product-service system (a system consisting of a product and a related service) that acquires its selected characteristics, properties, conditions, and behaviours by means of models, information, and data within a single or even across multiple life cycle phases." ([Acatech](https://www.acatech.de/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Forschungsbeirat_Themenfelder-Industrie-4.0-2.pdf))
- "Digital representation sufficient to meet the requirements of a set of use cases." ([Industrial Digital Twin Association](https://industrialdigitaltwin.org/glossar/digitaler-zwilling))
- "A digital twin of a system consists of a set of models of the system and a set of digital shadows, both of which are purposefully updated on a regular basis, provides a set of services to use both purposefully with respect to the original system, and can send information about the environment and control commands to the original system."([Definition by the German Cluster of Excellence, updated after the Dagstuhl seminar on MDE of DTs](https://www.se-rwth.de/essay/Digital-Twin-Definition/))
